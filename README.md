## Introduction
Welcome to the **F1 Button v2** repository!
This resource pack brings the Java Edition "F1" functionality to mobile.
It allows you to completely hide your **HUD (Heads-Up Display)**, **Touch Controls**, **Hotbar**, and **Hand** with a single click.
Perfect for content creators, photographers, and players who want a clean, immersive experience.

## Features
* **Perfect Placement:** The F1 button is located at the **Top-Right Corner** of the screen, making it super easy to reach with your thumb while playing.
* **Hide HUD:** Removes Buttons, hearts, hunger bar, and XP bar.
* **Invisible Controls:** Hides the D-pad, jump button, and inventory buttons.
* **Lag Free:** Extremely lightweight.
* **Version Support:** Works smoothly on **v1.16 to v1.21+**.
